# Posterfy

Posterfy is an album poster generator. Given a Spotify link for musical release, it will generate a nicely formatted poster for it.

This project is currently unfinished; I plan on improving the UI, adding more styling options, and allowing non-Spotify releases to have posters made for them (custom data).

## Setup instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed.
3. In the project directory, run `pnpm install` and then `pnpm dev`.
4. Go to the localhost address that it says in a browser (usually this is http://localhost:5173).
